            Hacker breaches targeting corporate and personal data are worsening despite businesses and individual users adopting safe computing strategies, highlighting gaps in cybersecurity expertise. Cybersecurity workforce developer NukuDo addresses these gaps by offering specialized training that leads to guaranteed jobs in computer security.

The United States is facing a surge in major data breaches, including the theft of all U.S. Social Security numbers, a Chinese government attack on internet providers, and Iranian assaults on presidential campaigns. These incidents highlight the nation’s cybersecurity challenges, including a 400,000-specialist shortfall reported by the White House, despite extensive recruitment efforts.

For example, a hacker known as USDoD allegedly stole personal data from National Public Data, an online background check service provider, including the full names and former and complete addresses of 2.9 billion people going back 30 years. In recent months, hackers backed by the Chinese government penetrated U.S. internet service providers to spy on users.

Two ever-present obstacles enterprises face in locking down their cyber protections are a lack of cyber skills in existing IT workers and a shortage of qualified job candidates to bolster cybersecurity teams. Michael Blair, managing director of NukuDo, initiated a training program to address both issues.

Blair offers qualified candidates a six-month paid training program at $4,000 per month, a 401(k), and coverage for 100% of an individual’s health care costs. The program is followed by direct employment for three years. The package provides a hands-on learning experience and guaranteed employment opportunities open to a wide range of applicants, including recent high school graduates.

“We are attempting to revolutionize cybersecurity training. Our program is about doing something distinctly different,” Blair told TechNewsWorld.
<h2>Proven Training Model Expands Beyond Academia</h2>
<p>
  The training facility, based in San Antonio, is designed to prepare the cybersecurity trainees for success at a level that the future employer would not get if hiring from a traditional academic program, Blair explained.

With a background in recruiting companies to the U.S. and training, Blair had first-hand exposure to what he called a sister company located in Singapore, Red Alpha, that started four years ago. NukuDo’s first training class began in March.

Blair shared a recent conversation with a CISO, saying he thought a very significant portion of his workforce in dealing with cybersecurity could only follow a checklist of things to do.

“That is not really what the industry needs,” he said about filling the numerous digital security vacancies.
